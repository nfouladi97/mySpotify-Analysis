# MySpotify Analysis

This program analyzes a kaggle dataset from Spotifyâ€™s Billboard Hot 100, presenting data visualizations for accurate portrayals of the popular metrics. These metrics include genres, artists, and audio features (such danciability and speechiness) that makes a song reach The Hot 100. The project will be able to extract from the selected dataset, and visualize it with graphs such as pie charts and bar graphs using spotipy and matplotlib modules in Python.
