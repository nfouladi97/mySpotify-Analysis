# mySpotify-Analysis

This program will analyze a dataset from Spotifyâ€™s Billboard Hot 100.

The project will be able to identify popular genres, artists, and audio metrics that makes a song reach The Hot 100. The project will be able to extract from the selected dataset and visualize it with graphs such as pie charts and bar graphs using spotipy and matplotlib modules in Python.
